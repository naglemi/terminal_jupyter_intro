# Command-Line Basics Tutorial

This tutorial introduces the essentials of the command line, focusing on basic commands and their usage, complete with examples and expected outputs.

## What is the Command Line?

The command line, also known as the terminal or shell, is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer, where you can enter and execute commands.

## Basic Commands

### 1. `ls` (List)
Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

**Usage**: `ls`

**Example**:
```bash
$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos
```

### 2. `cd` (Change Directory)
Changes the current working directory.

**Usage**: `cd [directory]`

**Absolute vs. Relative Paths**:
- **Absolute Path**: Specifies the location from the root directory, e.g., `/home/user/Documents`.
- **Relative Path**: Specifies the location relative to the current directory, e.g., `Documents` when in `/home/user`.

**Navigation Shortcuts**:
- `.` refers to the current directory.
- `..` refers to the parent directory (one level up).

**Examples**:
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/home/user/Documents
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/user
```

### 3. `pwd` (Print Working Directory)
Displays the current directory's absolute path.

**Usage**: `pwd`

**Example**:
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user
```

### 4. `ls -lhrt`
Lists files and directories with detailed information in human-readable format, sorted by modification time.

**Usage**: `ls -lhrt`

**Example**:
```bash
$ ls -lhrt
total 8.0K
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Apr  1 12:00 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4.0K Apr  1 12:01 Pictures
```
